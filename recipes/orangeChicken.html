        <li>Remove chicken from the marinade and place into the bag of seasoned flour. Seal the bag and shake to coat.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken in the hot skillet until browned on both sides.</li>
        <li>Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and cover with aluminum foil. Wipe out the skillet.</li>
        <li>Pour reserved sauce into the skillet and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Mix together cornstarch and water until completely smooth. Stir into the boiling sauce.</li>
