    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) package egg roll wrappers</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut egg roll wrappers into 1-inch strips.</li>
        <li>Heat a wok over medium heat until very hot. Pour oil into the hot wok and heat until shimmering. To test the heat, lower the tip of a wooden chopstick into the oil; if it bubbles vigorously, the oil is ready. </li>
        <li>Gently place 2 to 3 strips into hot oil; cook until beginning to brown on one side, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Gently flip and cook until crisp and golden brown all over, 30 seconds to 1 minute more.</li>
    </ol>
