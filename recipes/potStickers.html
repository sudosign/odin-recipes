    <h1>Chinese American: Pot Stickers</h1>
    <img src="./potStickersIMG1.webp">
    <p>This recipe is specifically for Perfect Pot Stickers; provided by allrecipes</p>
    <p>Pot stickers, also known as Chinese dumplings or guotie, are a delicious pan-fried dumpling dish consisting of a savory filling wrapped in a thin dough wrapper. The dumplings are first pan-fried to create a crispy bottom, then steamed to cook the filling, resulting in a delightful combination of crispy and soft textures in every bite.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
    <h3>Filing:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>4 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li>½ cup finely chopped green onions</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons very finely minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups finely chopped green cabbage</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dough: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li> 
        <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</li> 
        <li>1 cup hot water, about 130 - 150 F (55-65 C)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dipping Sauce: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup seasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Frying: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 tablespoons vegetable oil for frying, or as needed - divided</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons water for steaming, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place ground pork, green onions, garlic, ginger, 2 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon soy sauce, sesame oil, and cayenne in a mixing bowl. Top with chopped green cabbage. Mix with fork until thoroughly combined. Tamp down lightly; cover with plastic. Refrigerate until chilled, about an hour.</li>
        <li>Place 2 ½ cups of flour and kosher salt in a mixing bowl. Slowly pour in hot water. Stir with a wooden spoon until mixture forms a shaggy dough. Flour your hands and transfer dough to a work surface. Knead dough until it becomes smooth and elastic, about 3 to 5 minutes. If dough seems too sticky, sprinkle with a bit more flour, up to an additional 1/2 cup, and continue to knead. Wrap dough ball in plastic, and let it rest about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>When dough has rested, divide into 4 equal pieces. Cover 3 pieces with a dish cloth while you work the first piece. Roll into a small log about the thickness of a thumb, about 3/4 inch. Divide each log into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a thin 3 ½-inch circle on a lightly floured surface to form the pot sticker wrappers. Repeat with the remaining dough pieces.</li>
        <li>Lightly moisten the edges of a wrapper with your wet finger. Place a small scoop of the ground pork mixture onto the center of a wrapper. Fold up the 2 sides and pinch together in the center. Pinch together the remaining edges, forming "pleats" along one side. Tap the pot sticker on the work surface to slightly flatten the bottom; form a slight curve in it so it stands upright in the pan. Transfer to a well-floured plate. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.</li>
        <li>Mix together seasoned rice vinegar and soy sauce in a small mixing bowl for the dipping sauce.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Place about 6 or 7 pot stickers in the hot oil, flat side down. Cook until bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Drizzle in water and quickly cover the pan; steam for 3 minutes. Uncover; reduce heat to medium. Continue cooking until water evaporates and bottoms are browned and crunchy, 1 or 2 minutes. Transfer to a warm serving dish. Repeat with remaining pot stickers. Serve with dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>
